# music_downloader

Simple downloader for music from <https://y.qq.com/>, <https://music.163.com/>, <https://www.kuwo.cn/> and so on.

## What's it

It's a simple python script which parses the music using `playwright` instead of normally `request` (so no need to inspect the devtools anymore!), then download, convert to mp3.

It's just for personal usage.

Notices: **If you want to use convert to mp3 feature, please install `ffmpeg` and add the `ffmpeg.exe` to the `PATH` environment variable.**
